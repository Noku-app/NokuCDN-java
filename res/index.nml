	  <p>
	    A <u>C</u>ontent <u>D</u>elivery <u>N</u>etwork is a service that provides
		content either as a module to a projects, or as a central server for many projects to
		refrence from. Such of an example are <a href="https://bootstrap.com">BootStrap's</a>
		CSS and JS files. When a browser detects that different sites link to the same source,
		the browser can reuse the source since it already knows the contents it cached when a
		different site accessed it earlier.
